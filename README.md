## A Simple Test Framework for Racket/Scheme

One of the goals was to not use anything which is high level according to the University.
I am not sure if I succeeded... up to them to decide.

Its pretty much a rough draft at this point but I think it works well enough to use
and since I wrote it myself I hope the university will let me use it on my assignments.

See `example` for usage and reference.
